# Coronal Mass Ejections / Solar Flares

P(>1M deaths in any year over the next decade): **0.2%**

Existing research on solar flare damage is confused and dispersed. (Complained about that [here](https://x.com/croissanthology/status/2014071957692531107?s=20).)

Utilities are required nowhere in the world to shield against these, and insurance does not get involved since this is a correlated risk.

## What seems to be true

1. We have [one](https://x.com/croissanthology/status/2014101664182026668?s=20) detection system able to spot a Carrington-event-level solar flare about half an hour in advance, and next summer we will have [two](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Weather_Follow_On-Lagrange_1). These work fine and are not the bottleneck.
2. This is sufficient for utility operators in the United States to hypothetically shut down the transformers large enough to get fried in time to shield them entirely.
3. New Zealand has explicitly rehearsed this move and can shut down its entire grid if it must, or re-route lines in case of smaller storms as it did in 2024.
4. Quebec has passive shields on their transformers that would let its grid ~probably sneak through a Carrington event with minimal damage, at an infrastructure upgrade cost of ~$100 per citizen.
5. Strengthening the US grid in a similar fashion would cost very little relative to the cost of most of its transformers blowing.

## What is also true

1. We have no fucking idea what's going on in China, despite China having far more transformers than any other country and far longer EHV lines (they are thus very at risk). Even European grids are obscure for some reason.
2. A Carrington event blackout would cause only a few thousand deaths if it lasted around a week, based on large-scale blackouts in the US we can recall.
3. However, transformers can take several months on an accelerated timeline to manufacture and ship across the country, and the few reports found are extremely pessimistic as to how well the US would handle e.g. a year-long blackout.
