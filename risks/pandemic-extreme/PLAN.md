# Pandemics (extremely lethal virus)

Worst-case subset of pandemic risk: an extremely lethal virus with high transmission and long incubation times (imagine AIDS as an airborne pathogen).

## Mitigation approaches

### Personal protective equipment for key people

More extreme methods of protecting oneself include:

- [Elastomeric respirators](https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/andrew-snyder-beattie-four-pillars-biosecurity-pandemic/#:~:text=If%20we%20can%20get,%E2%80%94%20Andrew%20Snyder%2DBeattie) (outside masks)
- Indoor [UV lamps](http://nukit222.com)
- Indoor [fog juice](https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/andrew-snyder-beattie-four-pillars-biosecurity-pandemic/#:~:text=People%20can%E2%80%99t%20wear%20masks%2024/7%2C%20but%20fortunately%20propylene%20glycol%20%E2%80%94%20already%20found%20in%20vapes%20and%20smoke%20machines%20%E2%80%94%20is%20astonishingly%20good%20at%20killing%20microbes%20in%20the%20air.%20And%2C%20being%20a%20common%20chemical%20input%2C%20industry%20already%20produces%20enough%20of%20the%20stuff%20to%20cover%20every%20indoor%20space%20we%20need%20at%20all%20times.) (propylene glycol—already found in vapes and smoke machines—is astonishingly good at killing microbes in the air)

These are all cheap enough that there's no reason you'd protect only "key people" if you were a government. But if for whatever reason of civilizational inadequacy governments do not distribute these, or if prioritization is broken in the early panic response as stockpiles dwindle, it would be wise of someone to spend a few thousand dollars on PPE *now* for key researchers to survive the beginnings of an extremely lethal pandemic later.

Note: this would not matter in a COVID-style pandemic. The bottleneck was clinical trials / manufacture / regulatory approval, NOT researchers. This plan postulates an extreme world where millions may die in the first few weeks.

### Food supply

If there is an enemy that developed the pathogen, they may've also targeted food stock. The United States has over 18 months of food stored, including for livestock. Producing nutritious sludge is easy and [cheap](https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/andrew-snyder-beattie-four-pillars-biosecurity-pandemic/#:~:text=Agriculture%20is%20surprisingly,and%20electricity%20production.).
