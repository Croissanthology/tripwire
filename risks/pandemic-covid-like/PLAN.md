# Pandemics (another COVID)

P(>1M deaths in any year over the next decade): **22%**

## Mitigation approaches

### Fast Grants

The Collison/Cowen project was the most effective fast civilian intervention early in the COVID pandemic (mid-April 2020). Fast Grants funded a few dozen researchers on extremely short notice, including notably the ability to run trial tests in Brazil to circumvent American legalese.

It did *not* accelerate vaccine manufacture and distribution timelines, and vaccine timelines were far more pivotal than anything else. Fast Grants' most successful piece of funded research was probably the Yale team that enabled cheaper-than-swab saliva-based [tests](https://future.com/what-we-learned-doing-fast-grants/#:~:text=The%20SalivaDirect%20team%20at%20Yale%20demonstrated%20that%20saliva%2Dbased%20COVID%2D19%20tests%20can%20work%20just%20as%20well%20as%20those%20using%20nasopharyngeal%20swabs.%20This%20work%20was%20critical%20to%20ameliorate%20the%20swab%20and%20trained%20clinician%20\(for%20swab%2Dbased%20test%20administration\)%20shortages%20at%20the%20outset%20of%20the%20pandemic.).

More than half the researchers Fast Grants funded claimed their research wouldn't have happened without it, and the rest say it would've taken another few months to get the same results via traditional funding routes. (See writeup [here](https://future.com/what-we-learned-doing-fast-grants/).)

### Fast Grants could have happened earlier

This means that **Fast Grants could plausibly have happened 4-6 weeks earlier than it did.**

There was researcher demand; the WHO declared COVID a pandemic 27 days before Fast Grants started handing out money; the Italian outbreak that spread panic in the world happened in *February* 2020. Fast Grants was, if anything, slow on the uptake.

### What Sentinel should do on pandemic alarm

This is unlikely to happen again, because Tyler Cowen and Patrick Collison will probably be on standby the next time. That said, the instant Sentinel pulls a pandemic alarm, emails to both these men seems like a good idea.

### Sentinel running its own Fast Grants

A lot of what Fast Grants was can be replicated quickly: setting up a website, frenetically contacting every academic on the original Fast Grants evaluator team, setting up a Manifund + asking for grants at various EA orgs if Collison and Cowen can't raise money fast enough.
