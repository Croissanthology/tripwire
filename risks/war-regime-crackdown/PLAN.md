# War (Regime Crackdown / Authoritarian Massacre)

For a case like the ongoing events in Iran: how to avoid ~12K civilian deaths and the suppression of a popular uprising against an authoritarian ruler.

## Key insight: documentation as deterrence

Iran shut down its internet more or less effectively. It's possible one reason the ongoing events are such a bloodbath is because Iran is confident little information comes out, and that it is difficult for the world to respond with widespread support if there is no poignant imagery floating around. Both Gaza and Ukraine as regions are more easily documentable than Iran, and also seem to garner more popular support in western countries.

## Iran's internet suppression tactics

(Per this Economist [article](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2026/01/12/how-irans-regime-has-hidden-its-brutal-crackdown?giftId=MzY2NmE0NTgtMGY0ZC00ZDUzLThlMTctZGI2Y2M5NmQ2ZTk0&utm_campaign=gifted_article)):

- Control of all telecoms infrastructure
- A separate internet for intergovernmental services
- GPS jamming to make Starlink use more difficult (but not impossible)
- Trapped decoy VPNs
- High-powered brute force jamming of Starlinks—works in dense cities but cannot be used effectively away from them. A protestor can film, then walk away and send videos through their Starlink.

Note: Russia attempted the same thing in Ukraine and was not very successful, in part because SpaceX sent over-the-air updates to [counter](https://restofworld.org/2026/iran-starlink-internet-shutdown/#:~:text=Russia%20tried%20jamming%20the%20satellite%20service%20in%20Ukraine%20starting%20in%202022%2C%20and%20SpaceX%2C%20which%20operates%20Starlink%2C%20pushed%20software%20updates%20that%20quickly%20countered%20the%20attacks.%20Tehran%20appears%20to%20have%20succeeded%20where%20Moscow%20failed.) it.

## Starlinks: current situation

Would flooding Iran with Starlinks one month in advance have done much good? Sentinel's budget could've afforded ~600 terminals, and there are an [estimated](https://news.satnews.com/2026/01/14/spacex-activates-free-starlink-service-in-iran-amid-national-internet-blackout/) 50-100K Starlink terminals in Iran already. Tehran is doing an impressive job jamming these, with an [estimated](https://www.intellinews.com/iran-raids-homes-for-starlink-equipment-as-communications-crackdown-intensifies-419492/#:~:text=Hashemi%20reported%20on%20January%2010%20that%20simultaneous%20access%20to%2080%25%20of%20contacts%20using%20Starlink%20had%20been%20cut%20off%2C%20suggesting%20authorities%20are%20using%20tools%20to%20disrupt%20radio%20waves%20and%20GPS%20alongside%20internet%20cuts.) 80% of Iranian Starlinks being unusable. The ball is currently in SpaceX's court for figuring out how to get through to their users, as they did in Ukraine.

**The bottleneck is no longer "flooding Iran with Starlink terminals"**—that's already happening.

The bottleneck today seems to be **"ensuring Starlinks can be hidden/distributed so door-to-door searches don't find them"**. As of October 2025, owning a Starlink [can get you](https://www.iranintl.com/en/202510093488#:~:text=used%20for%20spying.-,The%20use%20of%20Starlink%20or%20other%20unauthorized%20satellite%20internet%20services%20for%20personal%20purposes%20is%20explicitly%20banned%20and%20punishable%20by%20six%20months%20to%20two%20years%20in%20prison.,-%22The%20use%2C%20possession) 0.5-2 years of prison and execution if you're suspected of espionage. Starlink terminals are big black slabs that emit microwaves and say STARLINK on them.

On Jan 13 SpaceX waived subscription fees for Starlinks, though "being dependent on Elon Musk's will" is an actual constraint here.
