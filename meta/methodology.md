# Methodology

## Research process

- Risk probabilities are from [Sentinel's estimates](https://blog.sentinel-team.org/p/how-likely-are-various-precursors)
- Research was conducted using Claude Opus 4.5: specific questions were asked and sources were verified by a human
- All writing is human-authored; LLM assistance was for sourcing and analysis
- Reusable prompts are saved in `tools/prompts/` as part of the deliverable

## Framing

The question for each risk is NOT "what should civilization do about X" but rather: **"If you KNEW X was coming in 30 days, what does $300K buy you as a small org?"**

This is a tight decision-theoretic problem, not a policy paper.

## WIP markers

`[WIP]` tags throughout the plans indicate sections that need further research or detail. These are tracked and will be filled in iteratively.
